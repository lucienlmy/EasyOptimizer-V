# EasyOptimizer-V

A high-performance GTA V texture optimizer written in pure C with Win32 GUI.

## Features

- **YTD/WTD/YDR/YFT/YDD support** — Load texture dictionaries and extract embedded textures from drawables, fragments, and drawable dictionaries
- **Smart Optimize** — Batch resize and recompress textures with configurable max resolution, format, and mipmap settings
- **Fast Recompress** — One-click recompression of all loaded textures using the active encoder
- **CPU & GPU Encoding** — Toggle between bc7enc (CPU) and NVTT (GPU via `nvtt.dll`) for BC1/BC3/BC5/BC7 compression
- **Per-Texture Editing** — Resize, change format, and set mipmaps for individual textures
- **Duplicate Finder** — Find duplicate textures by name or data hash across all loaded files
- **Folder Scanner** — Recursively scan directories for all supported file types
- **Drag & Drop** — Drop files directly into the window to load them

- **Sorting** - Sort loaded archives by name, type, total size, texture count, or modified state
- **Languages** - Switch the main interface between 15 languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Arabic, Bengali, French, German, Indonesian, Korean, and Italian

## Saving

`Save All` creates a versioned project cache under
`projects\project-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm\` next to the executable before writing
files. It then offers:

- **Yes** - replace original YTD/WTD files
- **No** - save copies to another folder
- **Cancel** - keep files unchanged

The same popup also offers a cache-only snapshot without replacing files.
YDR/YFT/YDD inputs are read-only models: their extracted textures can be saved
as YTD copies, but the original model files are never overwritten.

## Building

### Requirements

- **Windows 10+**
- **Visual Studio 2019+** (MSVC toolchain with `cl.exe`)
- No external dependencies needed — all libraries are vendored

### Steps

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio** (or run `vcvars64.bat`)
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run:

```bat
build.bat
```

The compiled executable will be at `build\EasyOptimizer-V.exe`.

### Optional: GPU Encoding

Place `nvtt.dll` (from NVIDIA Texture Tools) next to the executable to enable GPU-accelerated texture compression.
